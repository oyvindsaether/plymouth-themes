## April Forever Theme v0.1.1
by https://linuxreviews.org/

## Requirements
You need to have the Plymouth `script` module installed to (ab)use this theme. That module
is typically in a distribution package named `plymouth-plugin-script` which should
provide a file named `/usr/lib64/plymouth/script.so`

## Installation 
- Copy the `april-forever` tolder to `/usr/share/plymouth/themes`
- OR just extract it there by running 
  `tar xfv april-forever-1.0.tar.bz2 -C /usr/share/plymouth/themes`
- Change /etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf so it says `Theme=april-forever`
